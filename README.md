## 🔐 Best Practices for Strong Passwords

- ✅ Use at least **12 characters**
- ✅ Mix **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**
- ✅ Avoid **common words or patterns**
- ✅ Don’t **reuse old passwords**
- ✅ Add **randomness** for greater strength

## 🚨 Common Password Attacks

### 1. **Phishing**
- Relies on human error, often via fake emails or links.
- Tricks users into revealing their credentials.

### 2. **Brute-Force Attacks**
- Automated guessing of all possible combinations.
- Long, complex passwords help mitigate this.

### 3. **Dictionary Attacks**
- Tries commonly used words and phrases.
- Easily avoided with random, non-dictionary passwords.

### 4. **Rainbow Table Attacks**
- Uses precomputed hashes to reverse-engineer passwords.
- Salted passwords and strong hashing reduce risk.

## 🔎 Why Password Complexity Matters

- ⏳ Increases time needed for brute-force attacks
- 🚫 Prevents easy guesses from dictionary files
- 🔄 Adds unpredictability to protect from automation
