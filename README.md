              CREATE MULTIPLE PASSWORDS
1.	password
2.	123456789
3.	abcd1234
4.	abCD12@!8
5.	a(1{C}2) De
6.	#GzgYA6cJI

           TEST ON THE PASSWORD METER
Password	    Complexity		  	Feedback/Suggestions
1.	password		weak			Dictionary word; Add symbols and digits
2.	123456789		weak			Very common; Add more complexity
3.	abcd1234		weak			Common; numbers and alphabets
4.	abCD12@!8		strong			Make it unique
5.	a(1{C}2) De		strong     	             No suggestions
6.	#GzgYA6cJI		strong			No suggestions


                BEST PRACTICE
	Use at least 12 characters
	Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
	Avoid common words or patterns 
	Don’t reuse passwords
	Randomness = stronger password


            COMMON PASSWORD ATTACKS 


•	PHISHING It is relies on human error to be successful. Rather than a hacker having to crack a password, The user hand over their SPII on a plate. That’s how phishing work through SOCIAL ENGINEERING email attacks.


•	CREDENTIAL STUFFING ATTACKS It is relies on the human tendency to reuse the same passwords. During this type of password attack, a hacker will try various combinations of stolen usernames and passwords, with the hope of gaining the access to an account where the target reused the compromised password. Hackers can obtain stolen passwords from the dark web.


•	BRUTE FORCE ATTACKS are among the most common and easiest methods for hackers to gain access to accounts-which is why they so widespread. To carry out a brute force attack, a hacker will use a computer program to try all possible letter, number and symbol sequences character by character, until hitting the correct combination, so they can gain access to a user’s account.


•	DICTIONARY ATTACKS While dictionary attacks are a type of brute force attack, there is a key difference between the two. Whereas traditional brute force attacks attempt to crack a password character-by-character, a dictionary attack will make its wat through a list of common words and phrases. Dictionary attacks tend to rely on variations of commonly used words, but more advanced attacks use details that are personalized to specific users-and these details are easy to find online.


•	PASSWORD SPRAYING ATTACKS Similar to the dictionary attack, password spraying is a type of brute force attack that works by attempting to access accounts using commonly used passwords. As the word suggest- is that it can target thousands or even millions of different users at once, rather than just one account. Distributing login attempts across multiple users and organizations rather than one single user also lessens the risk of the hacker being caught.


•	KEYLOGGER ATTACKS Keystroke loggers or keyloggers are particularly dangerous, because even the strongest passwords can’t protect you from them. This attack typically spying on victims and recording their passwords keyloggers record everything you type. This means hackers don’t have to guess usernames because they’ve already recorded that information. A common type of spyware, keyloggers work by infecting a victim’s device with malware. While physical device keyloggers do exist, software keyloggers are far more common. This means that to infect a victim’s device they need to make into the system-usually via a phishing attack, drive by download, or trojan. Once the keyloggers have infected a system, they’re almost impossible to detect, which is why, particularly in this case, Prevention is the best defense.


•	MAN IN THE MIDDLE ATTACK To carry out this attack the hacker disguise himself and sit between two different destinations and relay data between the two. Think of it this way, the hacker might set up a fake PayPal login page and encourage the victim to enter their credentials-but it doesn’t end there. The hacker will then allow the user access to their credentials-but it doesn’t end there. The hacker will then allow the user access to their fake site while using the stolen credentials to log onto the victim’s account on the fake site, the hacker performs on the real site and transmits any responses back to the victim. This way the hacker can only go unnoticed, but also ensure the credentials being entered by the victim are 100% correct.


•	RAINBOW TABLE ATTACKS This attack is similar to dictionary attacks-but use a rainbow table rather than a list of words, and can offer a faster password-cracking process. A rainbow table is essentially the key to deciphering encrypted passwords- its where pre-computed hash functions are stored alongside their hashed values. Using it, a hacker can compare values against this table and decrypt the hashed passwords in your database. Rainbow tables containing the solutions to common hashing algorithms can be found on the dark web, as well as generated using hacking tools such as Rainbow Crack and 0phcrack.


                PASSWORD COMPLEXITY

	Password Complexity Improves Security Because:
•	Increases time/effort for brute-force attacks.
•	Reduce chances of being guessed via dictionary attacks.
•	Unpredictable patterns = more protection from automation.
